            Definition of a Vinyl Pool
          </h2>
          <p className='lg:w-[670px] lg:pr-24'>
            A vinyl pool is a type of swimming pool that uses a vinyl liner to
            contain the water. The liner is a flexible, waterproof membrane that
            lines the pool interior, providing a smooth and durable surface.
            Vinyl pools are typically constructed with steel or polymer wall
            panels that form the shape of the pool, over which the vinyl liner
            is installed. The vinyl liner serves as the pool waterproof
            membrane, offering a smooth and comfortable surface. We specialize
            in creating these pools with precision and ease of maintenance,
            ensuring a cost-effective solution for those seeking a versatile and
